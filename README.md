HERO uses the LEEM algorithm developed by researchers at Wayne State University to provide location specific, real-time and forecasted electricity emissions data. LEEM (Locational Electricity Emissions Monitoring) is a data service that employs a sophisticated system of databases, algorithms, and power flow models that tracks, organizes, normalizes, analyzes, and reports out a myriad of real-time and forecasted electricity cost and emissions information that can be used by companies, utilities, “big energy data” firms, energy management firms, governments, individuals and others to make better energy and emission management decisions.
